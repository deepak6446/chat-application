# chat-application

# *What is this ?
## this application is a basic demonstration of how socket.io can be used for creating web application.
## It connects you with people which are near you.

# *How i can use it.
### clone this application using git clone https://github.com/deepak6446/chat-application.git
### go into folder chat-application do npm init (it will install all the dependencies for the application)
### now you can run the application using node server.js
### this will run the applilcation in localhost 
### open browser type localhost:3000.
### open more than one browser so that you can chat.

# *Problem
### Currently this application is getting the location using Geolocation API
### the Geolocation API will only work on secure contexts such as HTTPS. If your site is hosted on an non-secure origin (such as HTTP) 
### the requests to get the users location will no longer function.
### while running on local server it might work .

### Make changes to this application and Enjoy :-)
